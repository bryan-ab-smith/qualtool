# QualTool

This is a simple tool that will analyze a text and produce some insights into the text for qualitative (or quantitative) analysis. This is very much in development so more will come.

## Features
* Semantic analysis

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Install all the dependencies by running `npm install` in the directory with the package.json file.
3. Enjoy.
4. If you want to try it out, run qualtool against the `test_doc.txt` file provided here.

## Usage
The syntax is as follows:
```
qualtool <name of text file>
```
**_Note: This doesn't work as this hasn't been set up to install as a global module yet. In the meantime, you'll need to run it "locally": `node index.js <name of text file>`._**
